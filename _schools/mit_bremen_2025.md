## School description 
MIT, through its International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) and Global Teaching Labs (GTL) format, 
promotes the global nature of science and technology by enabling MIT students to travel the world, 
live with families, and teach schoolchildren under the guidance of local professors. 
At this school, two MIT students participated in a robotics STEM school at Constructor University Bremen with the support of JetBrains company. 
The school lasted almost three weeks in January and included preparation of materials and work with the Duckiebot hardware platform. 

### Key technologies 
* Ros2 
* Linux
* Python

### Outcomes
In the end, the students mastered the basics of working with Linux, SSH, Python, ROS, and the robot device. They implemented projects such as:
* Switching the robot's LEDs, like an ambulance.
* Traffic light system for the robot (the robot stops when it sees red and moves forward when it sees green).
* Training a neural network to recognize duckies acting as pedestrians on the road.
